🚀 I'm excited to share my latest project NewsApp, a news reading app built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose 📱💡

In the app, you can read daily news, search for news on certain topics, save them and read the news that interests you from its own site.

I integrated Room Database for efficient data storage, Retrofit API for seamless news retrieval and Dagger-Hilt for smooth dependency injection. 🛠️ The goal was to create a user-friendly and responsive application to keep users informed and engaged.

Also, I wrote tests for some functions and used what I learnt for testing in my application 🧪🔍

Kotlin Compose allowed me to design a modern and visually appealing user interface, while implementing the latest Android technologies ensured optimal performance and scalability.

Feel free to check out the app and let me know your thoughts! 🌟👇
